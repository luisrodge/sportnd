    <p>
      sportnd is a community where basketball player accross Belize will be able to start and organize their own
      Tournaments. Tournaments are played on the weekend at basketball courts throughout Belize.
    </p>
    <p>Now of course a tournament is oriented around multiple teams, but it also implies that once
      the tournament has been played that the winning team will receive some sort of prize. Within the sportnd community,
      tournaments aren't sponsored and that is because tournamets are funded by basketball players in the community
      who participate in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that in order to enter any tournament, participating basketball players
      will need to bring forth an entry amount required by the tournament on the day the tournament is to be played.
      Once the tournament has been played, the total entry amount from each teams and it's memebers will be rewarded
      to the winning team by the organizer of the tournament. That's right! Now we don't need to wait for some organization
      to sponsor a tournament, we can now organize our own.

    <h1 class="sec-title" id="starting-tournament">Starting a tournament</h1>
    <p>
      Starting a new tournament will be done using our website, sportnd.bz. In order for you to start a tournament the following
      requirements must be met:
      <ul>
        <li>Starting a tournament has to be done on either Saturday or Sunday.</li>
        <li>You can't start more than one tournament per weekend.</li>
        <li>If enrolled in another tournament, your new tournament can't be created for matching that date.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Starting a tournament is as simple as choosing:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A court near you where the tournament will be played.</li>
      <li>How many teams will be able to enroll in your tournament (2 minimum, 4 maximum).</li>
      <li>How many members should be in a team (2 minimum, 3 maximum).</li>
      <li>An entry amount per team member ($4 minimum, $6 maximum).</li>
      <li>A date and time for when you want your tournament to be played (Saturday, Sunday).</li>
      <li>A team color for which you want to enroll as (enrolling teams is as simple as choosing a team color).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="sec-content">
    <h1 class="sec-title" id="enrolling">Enrolling in a tournament</h1>
    <p>Enrolling in a tournament will be done using our website. You will be able to enroll
      in a tournament by enrolling a team or joining an already enrolled team. Once you've found a tournament
       you'd like to participate in it's as simple as choosing a team color to enroll.
       Your friends and only your friends will then be able to join your team. Since we use facebook as our registration
       method, your friends list will determine whether a member can join your team or not depending if said member is part of that list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, tournaments are inclusive, meaning anyone can enroll a team in a tournament, but teams are exclusive,
       meaning only your friends will be able to join your team .How much friends can join your team
       depends on the tournament. On the day of the tounament, you and each one of your team members will need to bring the required
       entry amount (either $4, $5 or $6) to take part.
    </p>
    <h2>Enrollement requirements are as follow:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You have'nt reached the enrollemnt limit per weekend. You can participate in a total of two
      tournaments per weekend. One on Saturday and one on Sunday, but never twice on the same day.</li>
      <li>The tournament is still in the enrollment period. The enrollment period for a tournament spans from
      the day the tournament was created up to the following Friday.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="sec-title" id="balling">Let's ball - the fun part!</h1>
    <p>As previously mentioned, all tournaments are played only on the weekend. The sportnd community
    is oriented around two concepts. The website, which is used to start tournaments or enroll in them.
    The basketball court, which is where the balling happens.</p>
    <p>
      Playing involves three phases - the organizer collecting
      the entry fee from each participating team and it's members, the acutal playing, and the organizer rewarding the winning team
      with the total entry amount previously collected from each participating team.
    </p>
    <div class="row phase">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Phase One: Tournament organizer collects entry amount from participating teams.</h2>
        <p>It is the responsibility of the organizer to collect the entry amount from each team, including
          his team, and it's members before starting the tournament. This verifies that everyone participating
          will be funding the tourament. Once this phase is done, the participants can begin playing.

        <h2>Phase Two: Balling</h2>
        <h4>We leave the finer details of the game up to you. You decide which two teams will play first, whether
          three pointers are allowed, play full court or half court, etc...</h4><br/>
        <p>This part is at the heart of sportnd. In order to have the best experience we ask you to please
        play <strong>honest</strong> and have <strong>sportmanship</strong>. These are the two pillars of the sportnd community. Without them there
        will be no trust and building of new relationships, not to mention that the overall fun for everyone
        participating in the tournament will be degraded. <strong>We recommend that the other teams
        waiting to play against each other keep track of the score between the two teams currently playing.</strong>
        Overall, Don't be a sore looser, and since the players playing against each other
        will be the one's calling fouls and other game related calls, it's imporant to be honest. Don't make bad calls
        while playing just to give your team an advantage. Follow these basic principles and you'll have an outstanding basketball
        experience. In the end, even if you loose you end up not loosing. You still got to play against other new players, established new
        relationships, and have a good time. So it's really a win-win in either case.

        <h2>Phase Three: Organizer rewards winning team with collected entry amount total</h2>
        <p>This is the last phase of playing a tournament. Once the tournament has been played, the organizer
        of the tournament is responsible of rewarding the winning team with the previously collected entry amount
        total, in this example it's $40. The winning team will then distribute the winning total amongst it's members.
