      Playing involves the following three phases:
    </p>
    <div class="row phase">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2 class="sub-title">Phase One - Tournament organizer collects entry amount</h2>
        <p>It is the responsibility of the organizer to collect the entry amount from each team, including
          his team, and it's members <span class="important">before</span> starting the tournament. This verifies that everyone participating
          will be funding the tourament. Once this phase is done, the participants can begin playing.

        <h2 class="sub-title">Phase Two - Balling</h2>
        <p>We leave the finer details of the game up to you. You decide which two teams will play first, whether
          three pointers are allowed, play full court or half court, etc...</p>
        <p>In order to have the best experience we ask you to please
        play <span class="important">honest</span> and have <span class="important">sportmanship</span>.
        sportnd tournaments are officiated by the teams and their players while playing against each other. <span class="important">There are
        no referees</span> - refereeing is instead done by the players. Without honesty and sportmanship there
        will be no trust and building of new relationships.
      </p>
        <p>We recommend that the other teams
        waiting to play against each other keep track of the score between the two teams currently playing so as to avoid any
        confusion or cheating.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">Phase Three - Organizer rewards winning team</h2>
        <p>Once the tournament has been played, the organizer
         has the responsibility of rewarding the winning team with the previously collected entry amount (funds),
         in this example it's $40. The winning team will then equally distribute the winning total amongst it's members.
